DR TV Workflow for Alfred 2.0
===========================

A workflow to browsing and downloading programs from DR TV.

The workflow allows you to browse all programs on [dr.dk/tv](http://dr.dk/tv) and open a video in your browser. Using ffmpeg you can also download the video.

Don't worry if you don't have ffmpeg installed. It's really easy. If you haven't already, install[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and run `brew install ffmpeg`.

The workflow has two commands:
- **dr (query)** Searhes DR TV for programs matching your query. Select a program to view all available videos for the program.
- **dr --week** Displays this weeks most viewed video.

You can select a video to open it in your default browser. Hold the option key and select the video to start downloading it.
